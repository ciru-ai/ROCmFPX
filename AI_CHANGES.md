## Session 001 — 2026-06-21

**Scope:** Audit and optimisation pass across `eagle3.cpp`, `rocmfpx.c`, and `scripts/rocmfpx-draft-profile.py`.

### `src/models/eagle3.cpp`

| Fix | Line(s) | Detail |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Log typo | 28 | `"EAGLE3gnorm_before_residual"` → `"EAGLE3 norm_before_residual"` (missing space broke log grep) |
| Style | 113 | Added missing space in `ggml_new_tensor_2d(ctx0, GGML_TYPE_F32,hparams…)` call |
| Concat dimension | 217 | Replaced loop variable `il` with explicit constant `0` as the `ggml_concat` dimension argument. `il` was always 0 for the single-layer EAGLE3, but using a bare loop variable made the intent invisible and would silently break if `n_layer > 1` were ever added. |
| Rename | 214, 257 | `inpSA` → `residual`. The variable is the residual connection target, not the self-attention input. Added clarifying comment explaining `norm_before_residual` behaviour. |

---

### `scripts/rocmfpx-draft-profile.py`

| Fix | Detail |
|-----|--------|
| Tokenize timeout | `urllib.urlopen(..., timeout=300)` → `timeout=10`. A stalled server previously hung the client for 5 minutes. |
| `p_split` emitted | All returned profile dicts now include `"speculative.p_split"`. Previously the key was absent, so `dense-coder` at `p_split=0.20` could not communicate that setting to callers. |
| 4-bracket context ladder | Replaced the single 48 k-token cliff with a stepped policy derived from acceptance-rate evidence in `ROCmFPX-EXPERIMENT.md`: |

**`fp3-mtp` policy ladder (new):**

```
< 16 384 tokens  → n_max=4, p_min=0.75, p_split=0.10
16 384–49 151    → n_max=4, p_min=0.25, p_split=0.10
49 152–98 303    → n_max=2, p_min=0.0,  p_split=0.10
≥ 98 304         → n_max=1, p_min=0.0,  p_split=0.10
```

**`dense-coder` policy (new — context-aware):**
```
< 98 304 tokens  → n_max=6, p_min=0.0, p_split=0.20
≥ 98 304         → n_max=3, p_min=0.0, p_split=0.10  (backed off at extreme context)
```

**`fp4-general` policy (new — context-aware):**
```
< 98 304 tokens  → n_max=4, p_min=0.0, p_split=0.10
≥ 98 304         → n_max=2, p_min=0.0, p_split=0.10
```

### `ggml/rocmfpx/rocmfpx.c`

#### C1 — Binary search for `rocmfpx_nearest_scale_ue4m3`

The original implementation was an O(126) linear scan over the UE4M3 table. Replaced with a binary search (matching the existing `rocmfp4_nearest_scale_ue4m3` in `rocmfp4.c`). The UE4M3 table is monotonically increasing, so the binary search narrows to a 2-element window then picks the closer neighbour. Tie-breaking kept identical to the old scan (prefer the lower byte value).

Estimated impact: ~18× reduction in `nearest_scale` call cost. Called ~(n_params/16) times during quantization — meaningful on large models.

#### C2 — Precomputed `rocmfpx_scale_table[127]`

Added a static `const float rocmfpx_scale_table[127]` initialised at compile time with all valid UE4M3 → FP32 values. Added `static inline rocmfpx_scale_lookup(uint8_t e)` for O(1) table access. All internal uses of `rocmfpx_ue4m3_to_fp32()` inside this file (MSE inner loops, scale-search clip checks, quantize/dequantize row functions) replaced with `rocmfpx_scale_lookup()`. The public `rocmfpx_ue4m3_to_fp32()` function is preserved for external callers.

#### C3 — `all_finite` fast path for MSE inner loops

`rocmfpx_prepare_mse_weights()` gained a `bool * all_finite` output parameter. Six `_finite` variants of the three MSE inner-loop functions were added (one unweighted + one weighted per format: FP3, FP6, FP8). These variants skip the `isfinite(x[i])` guard per element. All three scale-search dispatch functions (`_choose_scale_fp3_mse_impl`, `_choose_scale_fp6_mse_impl`, `_choose_scale_fp8_weighted_mse`) now propagate `all_finite` and route to the appropriate variant. In the common case of normal model weights (no NaN/Inf), this eliminates one conditional branch per element per MSE candidate evaluation.

#### C4 — Group pack/unpack replacing bit-by-bit `set_bits`/`get_bits`

**Removed:** `rocmfpx_set_bits` and `rocmfpx_get_bits`. Both looped over individual bits with a branch + read-modify-write per bit.

**Added:** Four `static inline` group functions:

| Function | Input → Output | Elements/call |
|---|---|---|
| `rocmfpx_fp3_pack8(dst, codes)` | 8 × uint8 → 3 bytes | 8 |
| `rocmfpx_fp3_unpack8(src, codes)` | 3 bytes → 8 × uint8 | 8 |
| `rocmfpx_fp6_pack4(dst, codes)` | 4 × uint8 → 3 bytes | 4 |
| `rocmfpx_fp6_unpack4(src, codes)` | 3 bytes → 4 × uint8 | 4 |

Both formats use the natural 3-byte group size (lcm(3-bits, 8) = 24 bits; lcm(6-bits, 8) = 24 bits). Every output byte is fully determined by the pack expressions — the `memset(yb->qs, 0, …)` call that preceded the old loop was removed.

**Rewritten:** All 4 quantize-row and 2 dequantize-row functions for FP3/FP6. Quantize collects codes into a stack array then calls pack in groups; dequantize unpacks all codes upfront then loops over elements with no bit arithmetic.

FP3 layout (3 bytes per 8 elements):
```
byte 0: v0[2:0] | v1[2:0]<<3 | v2[1:0]<<6
byte 1: v2[2]   | v3[2:0]<<1 | v4[2:0]<<4 | v5[0]<<7
byte 2: v5[2:1] | v6[2:0]<<2 | v7[2:0]<<5
```

FP6 layout (3 bytes per 4 elements):
```
byte 0: v0[5:0] | v1[1:0]<<6
byte 1: v1[5:2] | v2[3:0]<<4
byte 2: v2[5:4] | v3[5:0]<<2
```

### `ggml/rocmfpx/rocmfpx.c`

| Fix | Detail |
|-----|--------|

**Scope:** Improve ROCmFPX Dynamic Drafting for Qwable/Hermes-style agent use.

| File | Detail |
|------|--------|

## Session 005 — 2026-06-21

**Scope:** Add research-backed ROCmFPX Dynamic Drafting policy improvements.

| File | Detail |
|------|--------|
| `scripts/rocmfpx-dynamic-draft.py` | Added mode inference/pinning for coding, JSON, tool, chat, and completion requests; scoped state by profile, mode, backend, model, and context; added neighbor exploration for throughput learning; added optional per-position acceptance state and cap logic for servers that expose that telemetry. |

| `scripts/sweep-rocmfpx-backend-ops.sh` | Narrowed the default backend gate to runtime-relevant ROCmFPX cases so CPU/ROCm/Vulkan validation is not failed by unrelated upstream quant tests or unsupported permuted BF16-to-FP3 copy conversions. The old broad behavior is still available with `OPS=...`. |
| `docs/ROCmFPX-SERVING.md`, `README.md` | Documented mode-aware Dynamic Drafting, backend/model/context scoped state, exploration control, per-position cap behavior, and agent-safe JSON/tool defaults. |

## Session 006 — 2026-08-23

**Scope:** Make exact-M65 n-gram verification lossless by default for Kairic Edge v1.2.

| File | Detail |
|------|--------|
| `common/arg.cpp` | Keep Kairic n-gram drafting at 24/64/64 while routing exact 65-row verification through the compact/reference path by default. The previous native IU4 M65 verifier remains available only through the explicitly unsafe `KAIRIC_UNSAFE_NATIVE_M65_VERIFY=1` diagnostic override. Startup records the selected verifier mode. |
| `docs/kairic-edge-gfx1151.md` | Document the v1.2 correctness boundary, startup check, unsafe diagnostic override, and qualification evidence. |

### Validation

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Target equivalence | Strict compact M65 reproduced one byte-identical no-spec response hash across six repetitions. |
| Acceptance | `9,255/9,280` drafted tokens accepted (`99.73%`), mean accepted length `64.83`. |
| Performance | Five warm rows took `22.31–22.38 s` (`22.34 s` mean); approximately `5–8%` below the unsafe native verifier while retaining a `7.19x` speedup over no speculation. |
| Scope | PromptForge prefill, M1 decode, M2–M5 MTP, other row routes, context, API behavior, model, and sidecars are unchanged. |

Release disposition: promote strict compact M65 as the v1.2 default. Do not enable the unsafe native M65 verifier in production profiles.
